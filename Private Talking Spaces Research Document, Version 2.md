# Introduction

The Harvard Library Innovation Lab and Work-Shop Design Studio are collaborating on the design and development of a series Private Talking Spaces for the Harvard Law School Library. These spaces are intended to solve an exigent problem in the HLSL; students need private spaces, insulated from the surrounding library context, in which to engage in naturally noisy activities like phone conversations and remote interviews.

Effective use of space in Academic Libraries is a research question of general interest to librarians, institutional stakeholders, architects, planners, and students. A significant body of discourse exists around library spatial planning, and it varies in perspective from institutional reporting and social science work, to architectural design criticism, spatial planning reports, and financial dispositions. We surveyed a number of these sources in an effort to understand current practices, projects, and perspectives on the goals of recent spatial redesign efforts in Academic Libraries. Findings, corroborations or counterexamples from these texts are included where relevant, and a full list is included at the end of the document.

At it’s broadest, this project has two parts. The first part consists of researching, designing, and installing a series of Private Talking Spaces in the HLSL. The second part consists of finding ways to package and communicate the Private Talking Spaces for use in libraries and spaces beyond the HLSL. This document focuses on the first part of the project.

This document represents a set of definitions, functional requirements, and principles for the design of the Private Talking Spaces at the HLSL. Its core reason for existing is both to scope the effort, and to give us a set of tools by which to guide, judge, and critique the Schematic Design and Design Development phases of this collaboration. The critical opinions and insights of all stakeholders in this project are highly valuable to the group, and this document aims to be a guide to help interested parties contribute productively.

It also catalogs and references some research in spatial design strategy for libraries, focusing on data acquisition and functional requirements verification. Information synthesized in this document was aligned via a charrette at the HLSL, and elaborated independently by Work-Shop and the Library Innovation Laboratory at the Law Library.

The document concludes with an elaborated Project Strategy which concretizes directions and parameters for the schematic design phase.

*Finally, this document should be read as a living document, with this specific document being **version 1.** Feedback, continued ideation, and subsequent phases of work will undoubtedly create revisions to this document.*

## Some Definitions

We often use informal language in a precise (if not technical) sense. This section catalogs some of these terms, and gives provisional definition to them. Reading through this list should give a fairly good (if still abstract) overview of what our project is about at the core. This section can also be skipped over, and referred to if needed.

- **Booths.** Sometimes, we call the Private Talking Spaces “booths”. That’s just the vernacular.

- **Continuity.** To us, “continuity” means an uninterrupted and undistracted experience, an experience that aligns with one’s expectations of it. In the scope of this project, we are trying to *continuously* integrate the Private Talking Spaces into the larger library context.

- **Flexibility.** The Private Talking Spaces are an experiment in a new kind of space for the HLSL. This means that there’s a certain degree of uncertainty baked into the project, so we’d like to be able to test guesses, prove hypotheses, and make changes as we need to. “Flexibility” means the ability to do that.

- **Function.** A function of a space is a typically a service it provides. By way of example: the plugs in a table surface in the library are examples of functions that the table affords its users. Spatial “functions” are the tactics deployed by spatial “programs” (see the definition of program below).

- **Legibility.** It’s important for people be able to read information out of their context. In some cases, this means actually reading – signage – but often it also means thoughtful design around observed behaviors, instincts in existing spaces, and needs. In this document, a “legible” system or space is one that communicates its proper use to you.

- **Must.** “Must” is a term that’s common to Functional Requirements Specifications. We use it to denote a necessary facet of the project, an acceptance criterion which “must” be met in order for the project to be successful.

- **Opacity.** If something is “opaque”, that means its internal conditions are not obvious to an outside observer. Opacity is not necessarily at odds with legibility, in fact making some aspects of a system or service more opaque can help to make it’s critical components more legible.

- **Parameter.** A “parameter” is a quantity with a well-defined domain, which (in our vernacular) varies some architectural effect in space. By way of example: We might talk about window size as a parameter which we can vary to create different senses of enclosure and privacy in the Private Talking Spaces.

- **Private.** A private space is a space that is “opaque” to people other than people using it. The “Private”, in Private Talking Spaces implies that the booths shield their users from people who are not directly involved with their business in the space.

- **Program.** A spatial “program” is an usage goal or intention for a space. A core goal for this project is to introduce a new, private, and individual program into the constellation of programs that the HLSL currently provides and maintains.

- **Should.** This is another Functional Requirements Specification term. Things that “should” happen are goals which would be nice to have but are not requisite for success. “Shoulds” may become the “Musts” in future iterations of the project.

- **Small.** For the purposes of this document, human-sized.

- **Talking.** We’re actually using “talking” in a very specific way. We don’t mean any type of conversation, we specifically mean the kind of remote talking that comes part and parcel with phones and computers. The kind of talking that you do when, at least in a direct physical sense, you’re alone. Talking in groups (collaboration in general), while an extremely important activity to address in the library context, is not the direct aim of this project. This project is about “individual talking“.

- **Vibe.** The “vibe” of a space is the way its occupants read its affect. In the context of the HLSL, we might talk about a hushed vibe in the Reading Room, or a vibe or responsible ownership in the Private Talking Spaces.


# Goals

*This section of the document outlines the goals that we hope to achieve by introducing Private Talking Spaces into the HLSL. At the end of each goal’s section, we’ve added a few core questions that, as a group, we should continue to ask of the project as it matures. These questions (and others that develop as we move forward) should help us to assess the project’s state, and propel it towards its best possible form.*

## Noise Attenuation and Management

Private Talking Spaces reduce the ambient noise in the HLSL. They accomplish this by through their siting, their architectural form, and the functions that they make available to library patrons.

**Questions**
- Is it possible for me to do what I need to do in here?
- Do I feel comfortable making noise in here?

## Program Organization

Currently, there are no defined spaces for private talking in the Library. Due to this gap, students convert interstitial and liminal spaces (hallways, stairwells, and atria, for example) into places for conversation. The noise from these behaviors travels out into core program spaces in the library which are intended to be hushed or even silent spaces. The Private Talking Spaces address this issue by providing a zone in the library to receive these behaviors.

**Questions**

- Do I feel comfortable making noise in this area of the library?
- Does me making the noise I need to make in here disrupt other people?

## Field of Focus

Calls in liminal areas of the library detract from the attention and focus of two important groups: the people making the calls, and the people in the surrounding areas. Both groups suffer; while the one can’t fully focus on their call, the other’s focus on their work is similarly distracted. A goal of the Private Talking Spaces is to restore equity in the relationship between these two groups.

By setting up a well-defined space for calls, both groups maintain focus on their tasks, and neither group intrudes on the other.

**Questions**
- Am I distracting other people?
- Are other people distracting me?

## Discoverability

We intend to create focal points around the library which naturally attract and encapsulate high volume behavior. The Private Talking Spaces should legibly communicate their intent as *the* private talking spaces in the Library; they should be easily discoverable to students as places for them to take calls, have remote interviews, and be louder than normal.

**Questions**

- How do I know how to find these spaces?
- How do I know what these spaces are for?
- How do I know what I’m allowed to do in here?


## Flexibility

The Private Talking Spaces in the library are an experiment. As such, whatever form the Private Talking Spaces take should encourage the spirit of prototyping. Finding the ideal form of these spaces will take experimental research in the form of iterative deployments and community feedback. The spaces should be able to flex to meet new discoveries and information to whatever degree possible.

**Questions**
- How do we account for new and emergent usages?
- How do we account for prototyping and testing?
- How much does it cost?
- How difficult is it to build?

## The New Library

The HLSL is planning a major spatial rethinking over the next few years (starting in 2017). The timeline of our project positions us on the *avant garde* of this effort. As such, the Private Talking Spaces will inevitable help to inform how this spatial redesign happens, and which directions it unfolds along.  In responsibly doing the project, we should take into account the larger vectors that we would like to align our project with. By introducing new elements into the library, we’re helping to determine the architectural vernacular of the new library.

**Questions**
- How does this project fit into the trajectory of the HLSL?



# Existing Conditions and Siting

*In this section, we discuss existing spatial and experiential conditions in HLSL. We divide the Library into four different **types** of spaces. These spaces serve different functions and types of behaviors and inhabit different points along the gradients of noise and focus. We identify gaps in these gradients that suggest both sites in the HLSL as well as program functions for the Private Talking Spaces.*

![Existing Conditions – Floor 2](https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/680880/original_81bc7329038302183eff615e24de19bb.png)

![Existing Conditions – Floor 3](https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/680883/original_593318b342520afb056e5eff5a9e9465.png)

![Existing Conditions – Floor 4](https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/680879/original_79a610b7f08a85fb478c5d36cfd9a669.png)

We’re focusing our attention on the three student-accessible levels of the HLSL. Inside of this area, we’ve identified several different types of a spaces.

**Primary Spaces.** *(Indicated in Light Blue)* For our purposes, primary spaces are the freely accessible spaces which are allocated for students pursuing “traditional library activities“ – research, study, reading, quiet working. The Reading Room is the core example of a primary space in the Library. These are the spaces that meet the primary mandate of the space as a place for intensely focused work. The vibe and ambience in these spaces is one of quiet (even silent) study.

**Supporting Spaces.** *(Indicated in Dark Blue)* Supporting spaces are zones in the library which augment and support primary spaces with additional programmatic capacities. These include group study rooms and the open atria. In general, we’re thinking of supporting spaces as places that make room for (and contain) collaborative work. Ideally, supporting spaces enable a continuous – not disruptive – transition from primary spaces.

**Service Spaces.** *(Indicated in Dark Red)* Service spaces are zones that are in general inaccessible to students and library patrons. These include *back-of-house* and *behind-the-counter* spaces, but also things like faculty offices. The function and affect of these spaces are governed by whatever tenants happen to be inhabiting the space – as such, they are quite separate from the general intent and mandates of the library. Although they provide necessary functions (such as circulation, reference, or faculty housing), the experience in these spaces is quite different from the general experiential conditions in the library; they are intentionally bounded and discontinuous from the other spaces. As such, they disrupt and are disrupted the continuity of experience through the primary and supporting spaces. (Bathrooms are also a service space – they are indicated in the plans in a lighter red.)

**Border Spaces.** *(Indicated in Light Yellow)* Border spaces are the liminal zones in the library, the zones that don’t have any program function at all attached to them, zones like the stairwells, elevators, landings, corridors, and anterooms in the library. Border spaces are necessary conditions as they allow patrons to move from one space to another, but they also create regions in the library in which there is no prevailing program, and thus no direction about how to behave. This positions them uniquely as areas in the library that absorb all behaviors and needs that don’t currently fit into the library’s program. Individuals who need to do something that doesn’t fit in with the general vibe in the primary and secondary spaces find their way to the border spaces, which are often not architecturally contained or bounded from the spaces that that border. Noise and activity generated at the borders easily leaks back to the center.

![Program Spaces – Floor 2](https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/680878/original_0231e534b83c0ed88dbcc6cd25209caa.png)

![Program Spaces – Floor 3](https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/680882/original_f73418d04632c5b87a582dc39f1aa170.png)

![Program Spaces – Floor 4](https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/680881/original_86391d5f5785d01db311c4f1234fc60c.png)

Our current initiative is to reactivate the **border spaces** in the library in service of the HLSL’s evolving programs. [Both, Heitor, and Madeiros term these spaces “integrated spaces”, and point out that they form loci of activity and noise which bleed out into quiet study spaces – a spatial reflex which accounts for one of their top three negative features of modern academic libraries[^1]. We want to capture the activity that’s already happening in these spaces, and give it a home.

The border spaces are already serving as a sieve capturing the behaviors that don’t have a home in the library. Students making or receiving phone calls drift from the primary spaces into the library’s borders to make noise in the most comfortable way possible, but this isn’t quite sufficient; the noise still bleeds back into the primary spaces. In an interview situation, students set up camp in stairwells, in the special collections room, or in a hallway by the bathrooms. If they’re lucky, they might find room in one of the supporting spaces, but even this outcome is less than ideal, as it sacrifices a space for group collaboration to an individual need.

The noise bleed-back generated by the impromptu programming of the border spaces is creating an undesirable noise gradient in the library and a disruptive experience for patrons.

![Noise Gradients – Floor 2](https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/680888/original_7abf847e674468cb70266152ef2ed19b.png)

By inserting Private Talking Spaces into existing border zones in the HLSL, we accomplish several things.

1. We take a previously unprogrammed, transitory space and provide it with a vital program and a function beyond circulation. Focusing on these “spaces-between-spaces“ gives us a unique potential[^2]; Boundary conditions in the library become intentional zones for noisy behavior, and the Private Talking Spaces make that behavior responsible and appropriate.

2. We formalize an emergent usage pattern. Patrons have already programmed and are using the border zones as spaces to absorb the programs they need, and understand these spaces as such. We’re simply formalizing their requests, supporting their need, and building the infrastructure they need.

The initial sites for the Private Talking Spaces are the central landing zones on each effected floor in the Library (*indicated in dark yellow in the plans below*). These central zones are the circulatory core of the library, and form a contiguous vertical region through each floor.

We’ll unite these regions on each floor (carrying the footprint of the landings on the 2nd and 3rd floors up into the 4th floor) by introducing Private Talking Spaces, unifying these zones as the home base for noisy activity while containing that activity in a home.

![Areas of Effect – Floor 2](https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/680887/original_fb22b2bd222c9361a86155f111a3d904.png)

Our first step will be to place a prototype Private Talking Space (*indicated in dark blue*) in the Reading Room’s landing zone. This Prototype will be designed and built to allow us to observe the details of the spectrum of activities that take place in the HLSL’s border zones. By doing this, we’ll develop an enriched understanding of how the architecture of the Private Talking Spaces should be positioned, and where, how the continuum of functional requirements implementation, the booths should be articulated.

The following section introduces the Function Requirements continua that this prototype should measure.


# Program and Functional Requirements

*This section outlines the critical functions that the Private Talking spaces must enable. Some of these functions are spectra of functionality to be explored rather than specific points to be targeted. In the following section, we outline a strategy for honing these parameters through prototyping. In general, these specifications represent initial conditions for prototyping that will be dialed in through iteration. Like the goals at the beginning of this document, each functional requirement listed below has a set of questions associated with it to help guide prototyping and assessment.*

## Noise Containment
The Private Talking Spaces must be sound proofed, or at least sound-attenuating to an extremely high degree. As part of the goals of flexibility in the space and continuity with the space,  the Private Talking Spaces must have the capacity to be embedded in different library spaces in a natural way – without disrupting the surrounding condition. Given that our initial siting plan includes placing a booth centrally in the Reading Room, it’s imperative that the booths act as bounded islands of sound within larger ocean of quiet calm (forgive the metaphor).

**Questions**
- Exactly how soundproof do the booths need to be? Do they need to be 100% sound blocking, or can they allow for some attenuated bleed-out?
- What kind of ambient sound is okay inside the booth? Is white noise from a fan okay? Should it be absolutely quiet? Is a certain baseline hum desirable?

## Legible Occupancy
It’s important for people on the outside who would like to use the booth to judge whether the booth is occupied or not. This implies some level of transparency to the operation of the booth. This could be mechanical solution (like the mechanism on the doors of some public restrooms that indicate when the door is locked), a remote solution (like an integration with an online reservation system), or geometric solution, like an appropriate set of transparent surfaces on the booth itself. There are pros and cons to each of these directions.

**Questions**
- How much of the activity inside the booth should people outside it be aware of?


## Private Activity
It’s equally important for occupants of the booths to feel protected from the exterior. The booths are intended to be safe havens for sensitive telephone conversations and interviews, so they do need to create a sense of privacy and enclosure. People outside shouldn’t be able to see too much of the interior. Taken with the requirement above, the booths should embody a kind of translucency – they should be neither fully transparent, not fully opaque.

**Questions**
- How does varying the opacity of the booth affect the kinds of activities that are comfortable for people in the booth?

## Temporary Ownership
Ownership of the Private Talking Spaces should feel like it is temporarily “granted” to whomever’s using them. For the duration of their occupancy in a booth, that booth is theirs. However, it must always be apparent that the booth is collectively owned by the larger HLSL community. It should be clear that the booth may be occupied for a call, or an interview, and for windows of prep or decompression around those events, but that it’s not a place to camp out, do quiet work, or sleep. The booths are a limited resource for the library community and should be treated as such.

**Questions**
- How does the booth’s interior contribute to the way the booth is cared for by its users?
- How does the booth’s interior affect the length of occupancy?

## Individual Space
The Private Talking Spaces are individual spaces. They are meant to be occupied by one person. For the time being, they’re not meant to accommodate more than one. They should feel comfortable for a single person, but probably doable but a bit cramped for two, and impossible for three.

**Questions**
- What is the ideal size, perceptually and actually, for an single individual to occupy?

## Accessibility
The booths should be accessible to users in wheelchairs and other physical assistive devices. The booths should do their utmost to comply with the [ADA Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/buildings-and-sites/about-the-ada-standards/background/adaag).


## Power
For the purpose of supporting electronic communication and especially video interviews and conferencing, the booths should provide wall-socket style outlets. These outlets should be tucked out of the way and should manage the inevitable cables and plugs well.

## Climate
The Private Talking Spaces are small, enclosed boxes, and they’ll need some sort of either active or passive ventilation to keep them at a comfortable climate. This climate control must not interfere with the Noise Containment requirement, either!

## Light
It’s probable that the booths will be used more heavily during the day than at night, but regardless, they should have some internal lighting that’s flattering to the user and doesn’t cause glare on their screens.

## Waste
The booths shouldn’t become a place for people to leave their detritus. This means that it should be difficult to forget your personal effects inside the booth, but it also means that users of the booth should feel a responsibility to keep the booths clean.


# Project Strategy

*In this section, we outline the direct strategy for the project moving forward.*

In writing this document, it’s become clear that we’ll require a physical prototype in the Library for students to use. This prototype will need to be “parameterized” by the functional requirement manifestations we need to measure (as outlined in the previous section). In addition to this, we’ll need a way of recording the effects of varying these conditions.

By varying the parameters on the prototype and watching how people’s attitudes towards and usage of the booths change, we’ll learn what the ultimate form of the Private Talking Spaces should be, while getting a sense of usage patterns and demand. This will allow us to develop a production version of the Private Talking Spaces with a high degree of confidence in our investment.

Our first two steps are concurrent: We’ll begin schematic design on a **Prototype Private Talking Space**, which allows us to vary and measure the functions described above. At the same time, we’d like to some initial confirmation of our instincts about how border zones are working in the library (or else be able to pivot in a new direction quickly). To do that, we’d like to administer a short survey during 2016’s Library Fest at the HLSL (*see the appendix for an initial set of questions*). We’d like to collaborate directly with the LIL in terms of finalizing these questions, delivering the survey, and incentivizing participation.

We’ll finish the schematic design for the Prototype Booth around the time when we collect the results from the Library Fest Survey. We’ll review both with the LIL and collaboratively assess whether the questions and functions outlined in this document (or a subsequent version of it) are met by the schematic design of the prototype.

> *As an aside, a schematic design is a design which determines how programmatic and functional requirements are folded together as architectural form. It is not (yet) a design that discusses how such a form is built.*

Following our consensus on schematic design, Work-Shop will detail and elaborate on the schematic for the Prototype Booth ultimately producing Construction Documentation and the built Prototype Booth, installed in the Library.

After installing the Prototype, we’ll need some time to observe it in use.

Our findings from observation of the Prototype will serve as the foundation for a condensed second round of Design Development and Construction Documentation, resulting in a fully detailed production-ready Private Talking Space design.

We’ll conclude the first part of the project by building 4 – 6 of these booths and install them in HLSL.
